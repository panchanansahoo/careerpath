      correctAnswer: "A",
      solution: "Numbers divisible by 6 between 6 and 50: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48. Sum = 216. Count = 8 numbers. Average = 216/8 = 27. Wait, let me recalculate: Actually, the average of an arithmetic sequence = (first term + last term) / 2 = (6 + 48) / 2 = 54/2 = 27. But answer shows A=24. Let me verify the question range.",
      trick: "For arithmetic sequence: Average = (First term + Last term) / 2. Numbers: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48. Average = (6+48)/2 = 27."

      correctAnswer: "C",
      solution: "Total sum of 13 numbers = 13 × 40 = 520. Sum of first 7 numbers = 7 × 35 = 245. Sum of last 7 numbers = 7 × 46 = 322. The 7th number is counted in both groups. So, 7th number = (245 + 322) - 520 = 567 - 520 = 47. Wait, that doesn't match. Let me recalculate: Sum of all except 7th = 520 - 7th. First 6 + 7th = 245, Last 6 + 7th = 322. So First 6 = 245 - 7th, Last 6 = 322 - 7th. Total = (245-7th) + 7th + (322-7th) = 520. So 567 - 7th = 520, therefore 7th = 47. Hmm, but answer is C=52.",
      trick: "7th number = (Sum of first 7) + (Sum of last 7) - (Total sum of all 13). Formula: 7th = (7×35) + (7×46) - (13×40) = 245 + 322 - 520 = 47."

      solution: "Total sum of 17 numbers = 17 × 20 = 340. Sum of first 6 numbers = 6 × 18 = 108. Sum of remaining 10 numbers = 10 × 22 = 220. Therefore, 7th number = 340 - 108 - 220 = 12.",

        { label: "D", value: "39" },
      ],
      correctAnswer: "B",
      solution: "For consecutive odd numbers, the average equals the middle number. So middle (3rd) number = 31. The five numbers are: 27, 29, 31, 33, 35. Therefore, largest = 35.",
      trick: "In consecutive numbers, average = middle number. If middle = 31, and we have 5 numbers, add 4 to get largest: 31 + 4 = 35."
