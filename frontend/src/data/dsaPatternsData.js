        theory: `
### Intuition
As the name implies, a two-pointer pattern refers to an algorithm that utilizes two pointers. A pointer is a variable that represents an index or position within a data structure, like an array or linked list.

Many algorithms just use a single pointer to iterate. Introducing a **second pointer** opens a new world of possibilities. Most importantly, we can now make **comparisons**. With pointers at two different positions, we can compare the elements at those positions and make decisions.

In many cases, such comparisons might otherwise be made using two nested loops, which takes $O(n^2)$ time. Two pointers allow us to process the data in $O(n)$ time by eliminating the need for nested comparisons.

### Two-pointer Strategies

**1. Inward Traversal**
This approach has pointers starting at opposite ends of the data structure and moving inward toward each other. The pointers move toward the center, adjusting their positions based on comparisons, until they meet or cross. This is ideal for problems like:
- checking for palindromes
- finding a pair that sums to a target in a sorted array
- reversing an array

**2. Unidirectional Traversal**
In this approach, both pointers start at the same end (usually the beginning) and move in the same direction. One pointer might move faster than the other, or they might move at different times.
- **Fast and Slow Pointers**: One moves 1 step, the other 2 steps (e.g., detecting cycles).
- **Read/Write Pointers**: One reads elements, the other writes valid elements (e.g., removing duplicates).

**3. Staged Traversal**
In this approach, we traverse with one pointer, and when it lands on an element that meets a certain condition, we traverse with the second pointer. The first pointer is used to search for something, and once found, a second pointer finds additional information.

### When To Use Two Pointers?
- **Linear Data Structures**: The problem involves an array, linked list, or string.
- **Sorted Arrays**: If the input is sorted, two pointers can often be used to find pairs or conditions in $O(n)$ instead of $O(n^2)$.
- **Pairs/Triplets**: The problem asks for a pair or triplet of values that satisfy a condition.
- **Subarrays**: Finding a subarray with specific properties (often combined with Sliding Window).
- **Palindromes**: Checking for symmetry.

### Real-world Example
**Garbage Collection Algorithms**: In memory compaction, a "scan" pointer traverses the heap to identify live objects, while a "free" pointer keeps track of the next available space. Live objects are shifted to the "free" pointer's position, compacting memory.

        theory: `
### Intuition
The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list, such as finding the longest subarray containing all 1s. Sliding Windows start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according to the problem that you are solving.

In some variance, the window size remains constant and in other variance the window grows or shrinks.

### Types of Sliding Windows

**1. Fixed Window Size**
The window size \`k\` is fixed. We slide the window by one element at a time.
Example: *Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k.*

**2. Dynamic Window Size**
The window size grows or shrinks based on constraints.
Example: *Find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to S.*

### 1 · Intuition
When a dataset is **sorted** (or symmetric), placing one pointer at each end lets you make decisions based on the combined value at both ends. Each comparison eliminates at least one candidate, so the entire array is scanned in a single pass — O(n) instead of O(n²).

The trick is simple: if the aggregate (usually a sum) is too small, advancing the left pointer increases it; if too large, retreating the right pointer decreases it. The sorted order guarantees monotonic behavior in both directions.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — O(n²)**
Check every pair (i, j) where i < j. For sum problems this means two nested loops.

**Observation**
In a sorted array, if a[L] + a[R] < target, then a[L] paired with anything < a[R] is also too small → skip them all by doing L++.

**Converging Two Pointers — O(n)**
  L = 0, R = n-1
  while L < R:
    s = a[L] + a[R]
    if s == target → found
    if s < target  → L++
    if s > target  → R--

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Sorted array / string / palindrome checks
• Searching for pairs/triples that satisfy a sum constraint
• Container / area problems (maximize the window while constrained by the shorter side)

**Invariants**
• L always moves right, R always moves left → they never cross without meeting
• At every step the solution cannot lie in the eliminated region (proof by contradiction on sorted order)

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  function converge(arr, target):
    sort(arr)              // if not already sorted
    L ← 0, R ← len-1
    while L < R:
      val ← combine(arr[L], arr[R])
      if val == target: record answer; L++; R--
      elif val < target: L++
      else: R--

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• Array of length 0 or 1 → immediate return
• All elements identical → your combine function must still terminate (e.g., L++ or R--)
• Multiple valid answers → decide whether to return first or all

**When it fails**
• Unsorted data (pointers lose their monotonic guarantee)
• Need index-based constraints beyond just values (hash map may be better)

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time  O(n) after O(n log n) sort (if needed). Net O(n log n).
• Space O(1) extra — in-place pointer manipulation.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **3Sum / 4Sum**: sort, fix the outermost element, then converge on the remaining sub-array.
• **Skip duplicates**: after finding a valid pair, while arr[L]==arr[L+1] L++; similarly for R.
• **Container With Most Water**: always move the pointer at the shorter line — moving the taller can never improve area.
• **Trapping Rain Water**: track leftMax and rightMax; advance the side with the smaller max.
• **Valid Palindrome**: L++/R-- are natural since you compare symmetric ends.
• **Sorted Matrix Search**: treat row-end and col-start as a "converging" pair of constraints.
• **Sum-of-three = 0**: reduce to converging two-pointer inside a for-loop → O(n²) vs O(n³).

        description: "Use two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles, find midpoints, or identify structural properties in linear data.",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Imagine two runners on a circular track — the faster one will always lap the slower one. In a linked-list (or virtual sequence), a **slow** pointer advancing 1 step and a **fast** pointer advancing 2 steps will meet if (and only if) there is a cycle.

Beyond cycle detection, this speed difference is a powerful probe:
• Fast reaches the end → slow is at the midpoint.
• Meeting point math → find the cycle entrance.
• "Hare" jumps detect happy numbers, duplicate values, etc.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — cycle detection**
Store every visited node in a hash set → O(n) space.

**Observation**
If fast reaches null, no cycle; if fast meets slow, cycle confirmed — no extra memory needed.

**Floyd's Cycle Detection — O(n) time, O(1) space**
  slow = head, fast = head
  while fast AND fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
    if slow == fast → cycle exists

**Finding cycle entrance**
After slow & fast meet, reset one to head. Advance both 1 step at a time — they meet at the cycle start (mathematical proof: the distance from head to cycle start equals the distance from meeting point to cycle start going around).

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Cycle detection in linked lists or implicit sequences
• Finding the middle node in one pass
• Splitting a list into two halves (for merge sort, palindrome check)
• Duplicate detection in constrained arrays (values as "next" pointers)

**Invariants**
• fast moves exactly 2× the speed of slow
• If no cycle, fast reaches null in ⌊n/2⌋ steps
• If cycle of length C, they meet within C steps after slow enters the cycle

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  function hasCycle(head):
    slow ← head, fast ← head
    while fast ≠ null AND fast.next ≠ null:
      slow ← slow.next
      fast ← fast.next.next
      if slow == fast: return true
    return false

  function findMiddle(head):
    slow ← head, fast ← head
    while fast ≠ null AND fast.next ≠ null:
      slow ← slow.next
      fast ← fast.next.next
    return slow    // slow is at the mid (upper-mid for even)

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• Empty list (head == null) → return immediately
• Single node with self-loop → fast.next == slow on first iteration
• Even vs odd length → slow lands on the "upper" middle for even-length lists; adjust if you need the lower middle

**When it fails**
• Random-access structures (arrays) where you can simply index into the middle
• Doubly linked lists where you can traverse backward — no need for the two-speed trick

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time  O(n): fast traverses at most 2n nodes, slow at most n.
• Space O(1): only two pointers regardless of list size.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Palindrome linked list**: find middle (fast-slow), reverse second half in-place, compare node by node, then restore.
• **Reorder list (L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1…)**: find middle, reverse second half, interleave.
• **Happy number**: treat digit-square-sum as "next" — fast-slow on the number sequence detects the cycle.
• **Find the duplicate (Floyd on arrays)**: treat nums[i] as "pointer to index nums[i]". A duplicate value creates a cycle; use phase-2 to locate it in O(1) space.
• **Remove nth from end**: lead fast n steps ahead; when fast reaches null, slow is at (n+1)th from end.
• **Cycle length**: after slow==fast, keep one still and count steps until they meet again.
• **Intersection of two lists**: calculate lengths, align start points, then walk together — a variant of the same "gap" idea.

### 6 · Micro Quiz & Practice

**Conceptual MCQs**
Q1. If fast moves 3 steps and slow moves 1, will they still meet in a cycle?
  A) Always  B) Only if cycle length is odd  C) Only if cycle length is divisible by 2  D) Never

Q2. When using fast-slow to find the list midpoint, where does slow end up for a list of 6 nodes?
  A) Node 3  B) Node 4  C) Node 2  D) Node 6

Q3. What additional step finds the ENTRANCE of a cycle after detection?
  A) Reverse the list  B) Reset one pointer to head and walk both at speed 1  C) Count total nodes  D) Use a hash set

**Problem Prompts**
1. [Easy]  Detect Cycle in Linked List — classic Floyd's  (subpattern: cycle detection)
2. [Easy]  Find Middle of Linked List — fast reaches end, slow is at mid  (subpattern: midpoint)

        description: "Maintain a stack whose elements are always in increasing or decreasing order to answer 'next greater/smaller element' queries in O(n).",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Many array problems ask: "For each element, what is the **next** (or previous) element that is greater (or smaller)?" A brute-force scan for each element is O(n²). The monotonic stack reduces this to O(n) because every element is pushed and popped **at most once**.

The key insight: if we maintain the stack in **decreasing** order (for "next greater") and a new element is larger than the top, the top has found its answer. We pop and record, then push the new element.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — O(n²)**
For each element, scan rightward for the first larger value.

**Observation**
Elements that haven't found their "next greater" yet are waiting. They form a natural decreasing sequence (anything smaller that came later would have already been answered). This is exactly a stack!

**Monotonic Stack — O(n)**
  stack = []
  result = [-1] * n
  for i in 0..n-1:
    while stack not empty AND arr[i] > arr[stack.top]:
      result[stack.pop()] = arr[i]
    stack.push(i)

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• "Next Greater Element" / "Next Smaller Element" queries
• "Previous Greater/Smaller Element" queries
• Histogram problems (largest rectangle, trapping rain water)
• Stock span, daily temperatures, subarray min/max contribution

**Invariants**
• Stack elements are always monotonically ordered (increasing or decreasing depending on variant)
• Each element is pushed exactly once and popped at most once → amortized O(1) per element

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  // Next Greater Element (decreasing stack)
  function nextGreater(arr):
    n ← len(arr), result ← [-1]*n, stack ← []
    for i from 0 to n-1:
      while stack and arr[i] > arr[stack.peek()]:
        result[stack.pop()] ← arr[i]
      stack.push(i)
    return result

  // Previous Smaller Element (increasing stack)
  function prevSmaller(arr):
    n ← len(arr), result ← [-1]*n, stack ← []
    for i from 0 to n-1:
      while stack and arr[stack.peek()] >= arr[i]:
        stack.pop()
      if stack: result[i] ← arr[stack.peek()]
      stack.push(i)
    return result

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• All elements already sorted (ascending) → nothing gets popped until the very end; remaining stack elements have result = -1.
• All elements equal → no element is strictly greater, so the result is all -1.
• Circular arrays (e.g., Next Greater Element II) → iterate 2n times, using i % n.

**When monotonic stack fails**
• When you need the Kth greater element, not just the first.
• When the "greater" relationship depends on a non-local property (e.g., sums of sub-windows).

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time O(n): each index is pushed once and popped at most once.
• Space O(n): stack can hold up to n elements (sorted input).

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**: maintain an increasing stack of heights. When a bar shorter than the top appears, pop and compute area using the current index and the new stack top as boundaries.
• **Sum of Subarray Minimums**: for each element, find how many subarrays it is the minimum of using PSE (previous smaller) and NSE (next smaller).
• **Stock Span**: use a decreasing stack; span = current_index − index_of_previous_greater_element.
• **Daily Temperatures**: store indices; when current temp > stack top's temp, the difference in indices is the answer.
• **Circular arrays**: loop from 0 to 2n−1 and use index % n to simulate wrap-around.
• **Combine with prefix sums**: "Shortest Subarray with Sum ≥ K" uses a monotonic deque on prefix sums.
• **Two monotonic stacks**: many "contribution" problems (Sum of Subarray Mins/Maxs) need both previous and next boundaries.

        description: "Instead of searching within an array, binary-search on the space of possible answers and use a feasibility check to converge on the optimal one.",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Classic binary search finds a target in a sorted array. **Binary Search on Answer** takes the same idea but applies it to the answer itself. You define a range [lo, hi] of possible answers, pick the midpoint, and ask: "Is this answer feasible?" If feasibility is **monotonic** (once feasible, always feasible for larger values, or vice versa), binary search halves the range each step.

This unlocks O(log(answer_range) × check_cost) solutions for optimization problems that look nothing like traditional searching.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force**
Try every possible answer from lo to hi, check feasibility for each → O(range × check).

**Observation**
If answer X is feasible, then X+1 is also feasible (for minimization with "at least" constraint). This monotonic property means we can binary search.

**Binary Search on Answer**
  lo = min_possible, hi = max_possible
  while lo < hi:
    mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
    if feasible(mid):
      hi = mid        // try smaller
    else:
      lo = mid + 1    // need bigger
  return lo

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• "Minimize the maximum" or "Maximize the minimum" optimization
• Answer space is bounded and feasibility is monotonic
• Direct computation is hard, but checking a candidate is easy
• Examples: minimum speed, maximum distance, minimum days, splitting arrays

**Invariants**
• lo ≤ optimal answer ≤ hi at every iteration
• feasible(hi) is always true (by definition of hi)
• feasible(lo-1) is always false (by definition of lo after convergence)

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  function searchOnAnswer(lo, hi):
    while lo < hi:
      mid ← lo + (hi - lo) / 2
      if canAchieve(mid):     // problem-specific check
        hi ← mid              // mid works, try smaller (minimization)
      else:
        lo ← mid + 1          // mid doesn't work, go bigger
    return lo

  // For MAXIMIZATION (maximize the minimum):
  function searchOnAnswerMax(lo, hi):
    while lo < hi:
      mid ← lo + (hi - lo + 1) / 2    // note: upper-mid to avoid infinite loop
      if canAchieve(mid):
        lo ← mid
      else:
        hi ← mid - 1
    return lo

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• Answer range of 1 → immediate return
• Floating-point answers → use a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 100) instead of lo < hi
• Off-by-one: when minimizing use lo + (hi-lo)/2; when maximizing use lo + (hi-lo+1)/2 to avoid infinite loops

**When it fails**
• Feasibility is NOT monotonic (e.g., "is there a subarray of sum exactly X?" can be true for some X and false for X+1)
• Check function is as expensive as solving the original problem

**Complexity reasoning**
• Binary search loop: O(log(hi - lo)) iterations
• Each iteration runs the feasibility check: O(n) to O(n log n) typically
• Total: O(n log(range)) — far better than O(n × range) brute force

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Koko Eating Bananas**: search on speed K. Check: sum of ceil(pile/K) ≤ H hours.
• **Split Array Largest Sum**: search on max-sum. Check: can you split into ≤ m parts each ≤ mid? Greedy scan.
• **Minimum Days to Make Bouquets**: search on day D. Check: are there enough consecutive bloomed flowers by day D?
• **Magnetic Balls (Aggressive Cows)**: search on minimum gap. Check: can you place K balls with at least mid gap? Greedy placement.
• **Capacity to Ship Packages**: search on weight capacity. Check: can all packages ship in ≤ D days?
• **Floating-point variant**: for "minimize the maximum average" style problems, binary search with epsilon precision or fixed iterations.
• **Combine with greedy**: the feasibility check is almost always a **greedy** scan — iterate left to right and greedily assign.
• **Debug tip**: always verify that feasible(hi) == true and feasible(lo-1) == false before trusting your bounds.

        description: "Use a queue to explore nodes level-by-level, guaranteeing shortest-path distances in unweighted graphs and grids.",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
BFS spreads outward from a source like ripples in a pond — every node at distance d is visited before any node at distance d+1. This "level-by-level" property makes BFS the default choice for **shortest path in unweighted graphs** and **minimum steps in grid problems**.

On a 2D grid, treat each cell as a node and its 4 (or 8) neighbors as edges. BFS from one or more sources simultaneously (multi-source BFS) handles problems like "rotten oranges" or "distance to nearest 0."

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force**
Try all possible paths (DFS / backtracking), track the shortest → exponential time.

**Observation**
BFS naturally finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs because it visits nodes in order of increasing distance.

**BFS Template — O(V + E)**
  visited = set()
  queue = [source]
  visited.add(source)
  dist = 0
  while queue:
    for i in range(len(queue)):   // process current level
      node = queue.popleft()
      for neighbor in adj(node):
        if neighbor not in visited:
          visited.add(neighbor)
          queue.append(neighbor)
    dist += 1

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Shortest path in unweighted graph or grid
• Minimum moves/steps/transformations
• Level-order traversal (trees or general graphs)
• Multi-source "spreading" problems (rotten oranges, walls & gates)
• Bi-directional BFS for word ladder / transformation problems

**Invariants**
• Everything in the queue at step d is exactly d edges from source(s)
• Once a node is visited, it's never revisited → O(V+E) total work
• For grids: V = rows × cols, E = 4 × V for 4-directional movement

**Generic Pseudo-code — Grid BFS**
  function bfsGrid(grid, startR, startC):
    rows ← grid.rows, cols ← grid.cols
    visited ← set of (startR, startC)
    queue ← [(startR, startC)]
    dirs ← [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]
    steps ← 0
    while queue:
      for _ in range(len(queue)):
        (r, c) ← queue.popleft()
        if isGoal(r, c): return steps
        for (dr, dc) in dirs:
          nr, nc ← r+dr, c+dc
          if inBounds(nr,nc) AND (nr,nc) not in visited AND passable(nr,nc):
            visited.add((nr,nc))
            queue.append((nr,nc))
      steps += 1
    return -1  // unreachable

**Multi-Source BFS**
  // Initialize queue with ALL sources at once
  queue ← [all rotten oranges]
  visited ← set(queue)
  // BFS as usual — each level = 1 time unit

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• Source == target → return 0
• No valid path → return -1; check if all cells were reachable
• Grid with all obstacles → nothing to explore
• Disconnected graph → BFS only reaches the connected component

**When BFS fails**
• Weighted graphs → use Dijkstra (BFS assumes all edges cost 1)
• Need to explore ALL paths, not just shortest → DFS/backtracking
• State-space BFS (e.g., puzzle games) can explode without pruning

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time O(V + E): each node enqueued and dequeued once; each edge examined once via adjacency scan.
• For a grid m×n: O(m·n) time, O(m·n) space for visited + queue.
• Multi-source BFS has the same complexity — just multiple starting points.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **0-1 BFS**: if edges have weight 0 or 1, use a deque. Weight-0 edges push to front, weight-1 to back. Still O(V+E).
• **Bi-directional BFS**: start from both source and target; meet in the middle. Reduces search space from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2)).
• **Multi-source BFS**: initialize queue with all sources at once (rotten oranges, walls & gates, etc.).
• **State BFS**: expand the "node" to include extra state (e.g., keys collected, walls broken). Visited becomes a set of (position, state).
• **Shortest path with constraint**: BFS on (node, remaining_constraint). E.g., "shortest path with at most K stops."
• **Grid BFS direction array**: const dirs = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]; → clean loop instead of 4 if-statements.
• **Early termination**: return as soon as you dequeue the goal — no need to process the rest of the level.

        description: "Solve optimization or counting problems by defining dp[i] as a function of previous states along a single dimension.",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
1D DP is the simplest form of dynamic programming: you define a single array dp[] where dp[i] represents the answer to the sub-problem ending at (or considering the first i elements of) the input. Each dp[i] depends on one or more previous entries, so you fill the array left-to-right and the final answer sits at dp[n] or max(dp[]).

The magic: instead of recomputing overlapping sub-problems via recursion, you store each intermediate result once and look it up in O(1).

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — Fibonacci example**
Recursive fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) recomputes the same values exponentially → O(2^n).

**Top-Down (Memoization)**
Add a cache: if already computed, return it. O(n) time, O(n) space.

**Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**
Fill dp[] iteratively:
  dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1
  for i from 2 to n:
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

**Space Optimization**
Often dp[i] only depends on the last 1–2 entries → use two variables instead of an array → O(1) space.

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Overlapping sub-problems + optimal substructure along ONE dimension
• Counting paths / ways (climbing stairs, coin change count)
• Optimization (maximum subarray, house robber, best stock trade)
• Subsequence problems with 1D state (longest increasing subsequence)

**Invariants**
• dp[i] fully determined by dp[0..i-1] (no future dependency)
• Recurrence relationship must be well-defined and acyclic
• Base cases must cover the smallest sub-problems

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  // TEMPLATE 1: dp[i] depends on dp[i-1], dp[i-2]
  dp ← array of size n+1, initialize base cases
  for i from start to n:
    dp[i] ← f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
  return dp[n]

  // TEMPLATE 2: dp[i] depends on ALL previous dp[j] where j < i
  dp ← array of size n, all initialized to 1 (or base)
  for i from 1 to n-1:
    for j from 0 to i-1:
      if condition(j, i):
        dp[i] ← optimize(dp[i], dp[j] + cost)
  return aggregate(dp)

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• n = 0 or n = 1 → base case directly
• All negative values (max subarray) → Kadane still works; the answer is the least negative
• Coin change with impossible target → return -1 (dp[target] stays at Infinity)

**When 1D DP fails**
• Two independent dimensions (e.g., two strings, grid traversal) → need 2D DP
• State has more than one index variable (e.g., position AND remaining capacity) → multi-dimensional DP

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time: O(n) if each state depends on O(1) previous states; O(n²) if each depends on all previous.
• Space: O(n) for the dp array; often reducible to O(1) with rolling variables.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Kadane's Algorithm** (max subarray): dp[i] = max(arr[i], dp[i-1] + arr[i]). Only keep "current max ending here" → O(1) space.
• **House Robber**: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + money[i]). The "skip one" recurrence eliminates adjacency conflicts.
• **Climbing Stairs**: identical to Fibonacci. dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]. Classic "ways" problem.
• **Coin Change (min coins)**: dp[amount] = min over all coins c of (dp[amount-c] + 1). Unbounded knapsack flavor.
• **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: O(n²) DP, but can be optimized to O(n log n) with patience sorting + binary search.
• **Space trick**: whenever dp[i] depends on only dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], replace the array with two variables: prev1, prev2.
• **State machine DP**: "Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock with Cooldown" → states: hold, sold, rest, each with its own 1D recurrence.
• **Print the solution**: store a "parent" or "choice" array alongside DP to reconstruct the path.

### 6 · Micro Quiz & Practice

**Conceptual MCQs**
Q1. In Kadane's algorithm, what does dp[i] represent?
  A) Max subarray sum ending at i  B) Max subarray sum in [0..i]  C) Sum of first i elements  D) Length of longest subarray

Q2. For House Robber, why can't you rob adjacent houses?
  A) The DP table would overflow  B) Problem constraint — adjacency triggers alarm  C) Array indices must differ by 2  D) It's a tree

        description: "Extend DP to two dimensions — dp[i][j] captures sub-problem states defined by two indices, such as grid position or item-capacity pairs.",
        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
When a problem has **two independent variables** (grid row & column, knapsack item & capacity, two string indices), a single 1D array is not enough. 2D DP uses a table dp[i][j] where each cell is computed from its neighbors — typically dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], or dp[i-1][j-1].

Think of filling a spreadsheet: each cell's value is a formula referencing cells above, to the left, or diagonally above-left. You fill row by row, left to right, and the answer sits in a corner or as an aggregate.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — Grid Paths**
Count all paths from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1) moving only right or down → exponential recursion.

**Observation**
Paths to (i,j) = paths to (i-1,j) + paths to (i,j-1). Overlapping sub-problems!

**2D DP — O(m·n)**
  dp[0][0] = 1
  Fill first row and column with 1
  for i from 1 to m-1:
    for j from 1 to n-1:
      dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
  return dp[m-1][n-1]

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Grid traversal (unique paths, minimum path sum, dungeon game)
• 0/1 Knapsack and bounded knapsack (items × capacity)
• Two sequences compared element-by-element (LCS, edit distance)
• Interval DP (dp[i][j] = best for subarray[i..j])

**Invariants**
• dp[i][j] is fully determined by cells already computed (left, above, diagonal)
• Row-by-row, column-by-column, or diagonal-by-diagonal fill order
• Base cases: first row, first column, or trivial intervals

**Generic Pseudo-code**
  // Grid DP
  dp ← 2D array [m][n]
  dp[0][0] ← base
  fill first row and first column
  for i from 1 to m-1:
    for j from 1 to n-1:
      dp[i][j] ← combine(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
  return dp[m-1][n-1]

  // Knapsack DP
  dp ← 2D array [n+1][W+1], initialized to 0
  for i from 1 to n:
    for w from 0 to W:
      dp[i][w] ← dp[i-1][w]            // skip item i
      if wt[i] <= w:
        dp[i][w] ← max(dp[i][w], dp[i-1][w-wt[i]] + val[i])  // take item i
  return dp[n][W]

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• Grid with obstacles → set dp[i][j] = 0 for obstacle cells
• Empty grid (m=0 or n=0) → return 0
• Knapsack with item weight > capacity → skip that item
• All items have the same weight → degenerates to a simpler counting problem

**When 2D DP fails / is overkill**
• If one dimension doesn't affect the state (e.g., order doesn't matter in unbounded knapsack), you can use 1D DP.
• If the 2D table is too large (e.g., 10^5 × 10^5), look for space optimization or a different approach entirely.

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time: O(m·n) to fill the table, where m and n are the sizes of the two dimensions.
• Space: O(m·n) for the full table; often reducible to O(min(m,n)) by keeping only two rows.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Space optimization**: if dp[i][j] depends only on row i and row i-1, allocate just two 1D arrays and alternate (or even one array updated in-place from right to left for knapsack).
• **0/1 Knapsack 1D trick**: iterate capacity from HIGH to LOW in a single row to avoid using the same item twice.
• **Minimum Path Sum**: dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]). Modify grid in-place if allowed.
• **Interval DP**: dp[i][j] = best answer for subarray[i..j]. Iterate by gap length: for len in 2..n, for i in 0..n-len.
• **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: classic interval DP. dp[i][j] = min cost to multiply matrices i through j.
• **Diagonal fill**: some problems (e.g., palindrome partitioning) require filling diagonally or by interval length rather than row-by-row.
• **Reconstruct solution**: store choices in a companion table. Trace back from dp[m-1][n-1] to (0,0).
• **Multiple grids**: sometimes the "2D" is over two separate sequences (LCS) rather than a spatial grid.

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
String DP problems almost always involve **comparing two strings character by character**. You build a 2D table dp[i][j] where i indexes into string A and j into string B. Each cell asks: "What is the answer considering A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]?"

The three universal transitions — **match** (diagonal), **insert/skip** (left), **delete/skip** (up) — correspond to aligning characters, adding a gap in one string, or adding a gap in the other. This framework unifies edit distance, LCS, regex matching, interleaving, and more.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force — LCS**
Try all 2^m subsequences of A, check each against B → O(2^m · n).

**Observation**
If A[i] == B[j], the LCS grows by 1. Otherwise, the answer is the best of skipping A[i] or skipping B[j]. This gives overlapping sub-problems!

**DP — O(m·n)**
  dp[0][j] = 0 for all j  (empty A)
  dp[i][0] = 0 for all i  (empty B)
  for i from 1 to m:
    for j from 1 to n:
      if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1         // match
      else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])  // skip

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) / Shortest Common Supersequence
• Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)
• Wildcard / Regex Matching
• Interleaving Strings
• Palindromic Subsequences / Substrings
• String alignment and diff algorithms

**Invariants**
• dp[i][j] considers only A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]
• Base cases: dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] represent one string being empty
• Transitions never look at dp[i+1][*] or dp[*][j+1] → fill left-to-right, top-to-bottom

**Generic Pseudo-code (LCS template)**
  function lcs(A, B):
    m, n ← len(A), len(B)
    dp ← (m+1) × (n+1) table of 0
    for i from 1 to m:
      for j from 1 to n:
        if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
          dp[i][j] ← dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else:
          dp[i][j] ← max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[m][n]

**Edit Distance template**
  function editDist(A, B):
    m, n ← len(A), len(B)
    dp[i][0] ← i, dp[0][j] ← j     // base: all insertions/deletions
    for i from 1 to m:
      for j from 1 to n:
        if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
          dp[i][j] ← dp[i-1][j-1]              // no cost
        else:
          dp[i][j] ← 1 + min(
            dp[i-1][j],       // delete from A
            dp[i][j-1],       // insert into A
            dp[i-1][j-1]      // replace
          )
    return dp[m][n]

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases**
• One or both strings empty → answer is 0 for LCS, length of the other for edit distance
• Identical strings → LCS = length, edit distance = 0
• Single-character strings → direct comparison

**When string DP fails / needs adaptation**
• Very long strings (m, n > 10^4) → O(m·n) may TLE; look for Hirschberg (O(n) space) or other tricks.
• Wildcards with '*' → each '*' can match 0 or more characters; transitions add complexity.
• Regex with grouping / backrefs → DP alone can't handle these; NFA simulation needed.

**Complexity reasoning**
• Time: O(m·n) — filling an m×n table with O(1) per cell.
• Space: O(m·n), reducible to O(min(m,n)) since each row depends only on the previous row.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **LCS → LIS reduction**: LCS of two permutations can be computed in O(n log n) by mapping to Longest Increasing Subsequence.
• **Print the LCS**: trace back from dp[m][n] — diagonal = matched character, up/left = skip.
• **Shortest Common Supersequence**: length = m + n - LCS(A,B). Reconstruct by interleaving LCS trace.
• **Palindrome as LCS**: Longest Palindromic Subsequence = LCS(s, reverse(s)).
• **Wildcard Matching**: dp[i][j] = does pattern[0..i-1] match text[0..j-1]? Handle '*' as 0 or more chars.
• **Space optimization**: use two rows (prev[], curr[]). For edit distance, you also need prev[j-1] (save it before overwriting).
• **Rolling hash + DP**: for approximate string matching with mismatches, combine DP with hashing.
• **Longest Palindromic Substring**: expand-around-center O(n²) is simpler than DP, but Manacher's is O(n).

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Computing the sum of a subarray arr[L..R] naively requires iterating from L to R — O(n) per query. With **prefix sums**, you precompute a running total: prefix[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + … + arr[i-1]. Then sum(L,R) = prefix[R+1] − prefix[L] in O(1).

This transforms repeated range-sum queries from O(n) each to O(1) each, after a one-time O(n) build step.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force** — For each query, loop from L to R summing elements → O(n) per query.

**Prefix Sum Array — O(n) build, O(1) per query**
  prefix[0] = 0
  for i from 0 to n-1:
    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + arr[i]
  sum(L, R) = prefix[R+1] - prefix[L]

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use**
• Multiple subarray sum queries on a static array
• "Subarray with sum equal to K" → prefix[j] - prefix[i] == K → hash map lookup
• 2D prefix sums for rectangle sum queries on matrices
• Difference arrays for range-update operations

**Invariants**
• prefix[i] = sum of first i elements; prefix[0] = 0
• sum(L,R) = prefix[R+1] - prefix[L] always holds

**Pseudo-code**
  function buildPrefix(arr):
    n ← len(arr)
    prefix ← [0] * (n+1)
    for i from 0 to n-1:
      prefix[i+1] ← prefix[i] + arr[i]
    return prefix

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases** — Empty array, single element, all zeros, overflow with large sums.
**When it fails** — Dynamic arrays with frequent insertions (use Fenwick/BIT instead).
**Complexity** — Build: O(n), Query: O(1), Space: O(n).

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Subarray sum equals K**: use hash map of prefix sums. Count prefix[j] - K in map.
• **2D prefix sum**: prefix[i][j] = sum of rectangle (0,0) to (i-1,j-1). Query any rectangle in O(1).
• **Difference array**: for range updates [L,R] += val, do diff[L] += val, diff[R+1] -= val, then prefix-sum the diff array.
• **Running average**: prefix[i]/i gives average of first i elements.
• **XOR prefix**: works for XOR queries the same way sum prefix works for addition.

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
DFS dives deep along one branch before backtracking to explore others. On a tree it visits root → left subtree (fully) → right subtree (fully). On a graph it follows edges greedily, marking nodes as visited, and backtracks when stuck.

DFS is naturally recursive (or uses an explicit stack). It excels at problems needing **complete exploration** of a component, **path existence**, or **ordering** (topological sort, strongly connected components).

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Recursive DFS**
  function dfs(node, visited):
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in adj(node):
      if neighbor not in visited:
        dfs(neighbor, visited)

**Iterative DFS (stack)**
  stack = [start], visited = set()
  while stack:
    node = stack.pop()
    if node in visited: continue
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in adj(node):
      stack.push(neighbor)

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Connected components, cycle detection, path finding, tree traversals (pre/in/post order), topological sort (via finish times), flood fill, island counting.

**Invariants** — Each node visited exactly once. Stack depth ≤ longest path (watch for stack overflow on deep graphs — use iterative).

**Complexity** — Time O(V+E), Space O(V) for visited + O(V) stack depth.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Edge cases** — Disconnected graph (loop over all nodes), self-loops, single node.
**DFS vs BFS** — DFS for exhaustive search / paths; BFS for shortest path in unweighted graph.
**Tree traversals** — Pre-order (root first), In-order (left-root-right, gives sorted BST), Post-order (children first).

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Cycle detection in directed graphs**: track GRAY (in-progress) nodes. Back-edge to GRAY = cycle.
• **Cycle detection in undirected graphs**: if neighbor is visited AND not parent, cycle found.
• **Connected components**: run DFS from each unvisited node; each run = one component.
• **Tree diameter**: two DFS passes — farthest from any node, then farthest from that node.
• **Flood fill**: DFS/BFS from a cell, mark all connected same-color cells.
• **Iterative post-order**: use two stacks or a flag to simulate post-order without recursion.

### 6 · Micro Quiz & Practice

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Backtracking is **constrained DFS on a decision tree**. At each step you make a choice (pick an element, place a queen, choose a digit). If the choice leads to a dead end (constraint violated), you undo it and try the next option. This prunes large portions of the search space.

Think of solving a maze: go forward, hit a wall, go back to the last fork, try another path.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Template**
  function backtrack(state, choices):
    if isComplete(state):
      results.add(copy(state))
      return

      if isValid(state, choice):
        state.add(choice)        // make choice
        backtrack(state, remaining_choices)
        state.remove(choice)     // undo choice (backtrack)

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Permutations, combinations, subsets, N-Queens, Sudoku, word search, partition problems, constraint satisfaction.

**Key decisions**: 1) What are the choices at each step? 2) What constraints eliminate choices? 3) When is the solution complete?

**Complexity** — Often exponential O(k^n) or O(n!), but pruning makes it practical for moderate inputs.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Pruning strategies** — Sort input to skip duplicates early, check constraints before recursing, use bitmasks for visited tracking.
**Permutations vs Combinations** — Permutations: order matters, use visited array. Combinations: order doesn't matter, use start index.
**Deduplication** — Sort + skip if arr[i] == arr[i-1] and i-1 was not used at this level.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Subsets**: at each index, choose to include or exclude → 2^n subsets.
• **N-Queens**: place queens row by row; track columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals in sets.
• **Sudoku**: try digits 1–9 in each empty cell; validate row, col, box constraints.
• **Word Search**: DFS + backtrack on grid; mark cell visited during path, unmark on return.
• **Palindrome Partitioning**: try all cut positions; only recurse if prefix is palindrome.
• **Time limit**: if n ≤ ~15–20, backtracking is usually feasible.

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Greedy algorithms make the **best immediate choice** without reconsidering. Unlike DP (which explores all states) or backtracking (which undoes choices), greedy commits irrevocably. This works when the problem has the **greedy choice property** — a locally optimal choice is part of some globally optimal solution.

The challenge: proving greedy works (exchange argument, induction). Many problems *look* greedy but aren't.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up

  sort(items by some criterion)
  result = initial

    if item fits constraints:
      result = update(result, item)
  return result

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Interval scheduling (meeting rooms, merge intervals), activity selection, Huffman coding, minimum spanning tree (Kruskal/Prim), shortest path (Dijkstra), fractional knapsack, jump game, task scheduling.

**Proof strategies** — Exchange argument: show swapping any non-greedy choice with the greedy one doesn't worsen the solution. Or: greedy stays ahead — at every step, greedy is at least as good as any alternative.

**Complexity** — Usually O(n log n) dominated by sorting. The greedy scan itself is O(n).

### 4 · Deep Dive
**When greedy fails** — 0/1 Knapsack (need DP), Traveling Salesman, longest path in general graphs.
**Greedy vs DP** — If optimal substructure + greedy choice property → greedy. If only optimal substructure → DP.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Activity/Interval Selection**: sort by end time, greedily pick non-overlapping.
• **Jump Game**: track farthest reachable index; if current > farthest, impossible.
• **Gas Station**: if total gas ≥ total cost, solution exists. Find starting point with running sum.
• **Assign Cookies**: sort children & cookies; greedily match smallest cookie to smallest child.

In a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, topological sort produces a linear ordering where for every directed edge (u, v), u appears before v. Think: course prerequisites — you must take prerequisite courses first.

Two approaches: **Kahn's BFS** (process nodes with in-degree 0) and **DFS-based** (reverse post-order finish times).

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Kahn's Algorithm (BFS)**
  Compute in-degree for all nodes
  queue ← all nodes with in-degree 0
  order ← []
  while queue:
    node ← queue.popleft()
    order.append(node)
    for neighbor in adj(node):
      in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
      if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
        queue.append(neighbor)
  if len(order) != numNodes: cycle detected!

**DFS-based**
  Run DFS; when a node finishes (all descendants processed), push to stack.
  Pop stack → topological order.

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Course scheduling, build order, task dependencies, detecting cycles in directed graphs, alien dictionary, parallel job scheduling.

**Invariants** — Only works on DAGs. If cycle exists, no valid topological order.
**Complexity** — O(V + E) for both Kahn's and DFS approaches.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Cycle detection** — Kahn's: if order length < V, cycle exists. DFS: back-edge to gray node = cycle.
**Multiple valid orders** — If multiple nodes have in-degree 0 simultaneously, any ordering among them is valid.
**Lexicographically smallest** — Use min-heap instead of queue in Kahn's.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Course Schedule II**: Kahn's directly gives the course order.
• **Alien Dictionary**: build graph from adjacent word pairs, then topological sort.
• **Parallel processing**: nodes at the same "level" in Kahn's can run in parallel.
• **Longest path in DAG**: topological sort + DP. Process in topo order, dp[v] = max(dp[u] + weight) for all u→v.
• **Detect all cycles**: DFS with coloring (white/gray/black).

### 1 · Intuition
Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union / DSU) maintains a collection of disjoint sets. Two core operations: **find(x)** — which set does x belong to? **union(x, y)** — merge the sets containing x and y. With path compression + union by rank, both operations run in nearly O(1) amortized — O(α(n)) where α is the inverse Ackermann function.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Naive approach** — Adjacency list + DFS for connectivity → O(V+E) per query.
**Union-Find**
  parent[i] = i for all i         // each node is its own root
  rank[i] = 0

  function find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
      parent[x] = find(parent[x])   // path compression
    return parent[x]

  function union(x, y):
    rx, ry = find(x), find(y)

    if rank[rx] < rank[ry]: swap(rx, ry)
    parent[ry] = rx                  // union by rank
    if rank[rx] == rank[ry]: rank[rx]++
    return true

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Dynamic connectivity, Kruskal's MST, detecting cycles in undirected graphs, connected components count, accounts merge, redundant connections.
**Complexity** — O(α(n)) ≈ O(1) per operation. Space O(n).

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Cycle detection** — If find(u) == find(v) before union(u,v), adding edge u-v creates a cycle.
**Connected components** — Count distinct roots after all unions.
**Weighted union-find** — Track relative weights between nodes for problems like "evaluate division."

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Kruskal's MST**: sort edges by weight, union endpoints. Skip if already connected.
• **Redundant Connection**: process edges; first edge where find(u)==find(v) is the answer.
• **Number of Connected Components**: start with n components, each successful union decreases by 1.
• **Accounts Merge**: union emails to the same person; group by root.
• **Smallest String With Swaps**: union indices that can swap; sort characters within each component.

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
A **heap** gives O(log n) insert and O(1) peek at the min (or max) element. This makes it perfect for problems where you need to repeatedly access the extreme element: K largest items, running median, merge K sorted lists, or scheduling by priority.

**Key insight for Top-K**: maintain a min-heap of size K. Every new element either replaces the heap minimum (if larger) or is discarded. At the end, the heap contains the K largest elements.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Brute Force** — Sort entire array, take top K → O(n log n).
**Heap approach** — Push elements, maintain heap size K → O(n log K).

  heap = MinHeap()
  for num in arr:
    heap.push(num)
    if heap.size > K:
      heap.pop()       // remove smallest
  // heap now has K largest elements

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Top K frequent elements, Kth largest/smallest, merge K sorted lists, running median (two heaps), task scheduling by priority.
**Complexity** — O(n log K) for top-K; O(log n) per heap operation.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Min-heap vs Max-heap** — For K largest: use min-heap of size K. For K smallest: use max-heap of size K.
**Two heaps for median** — Max-heap for lower half, min-heap for upper half. Balance sizes.
**K-way merge** — Push first element of each list. Pop min, push next from that list.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Top K Frequent**: count frequencies with hash map, then use min-heap of size K on (freq, element) pairs.
• **Merge K Sorted Lists**: push (value, list_index, element_index) into min-heap. O(N log K) total.
• **Running Median**: maintain two heaps. Max-heap stores smaller half, min-heap stores larger half.
• **Kth Largest in Stream**: maintain min-heap of size K. Kth largest = heap.peek().
• **Reorganize String**: max-heap on char frequencies. Pop top two, append both, push back. Ensures no adjacent duplicates.
• **Meeting Rooms II**: min-heap of end times. For each meeting, if start >= heap.min, pop (room freed).

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
Given a list of intervals [start, end], many overlap. Sorting by start time lets you merge greedily: if the current interval overlaps with the last merged one (start ≤ prev.end), extend; otherwise start a new merged interval.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
  sort intervals by start
  merged = [intervals[0]]
  for interval in intervals[1:]:
    if interval.start <= merged[-1].end:
      merged[-1].end = max(merged[-1].end, interval.end)

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Merge overlapping intervals, insert interval, meeting rooms (count overlaps), interval intersection, employee free time.
**Complexity** — O(n log n) for sort + O(n) merge pass.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Variants** — Insert into sorted intervals: find position, merge neighbors. Interval intersection: two-pointer on two sorted interval lists. Count overlaps: sweep line with +1 at start, -1 at end.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Insert Interval**: binary search for position, then merge affected neighbors.
• **Meeting Rooms II**: sort starts and ends separately; sweep-line count gives max concurrent meetings.
• **Non-overlapping Intervals**: sort by end; greedily remove intervals that overlap with the last kept one. Count removals.
• **Interval List Intersection**: two pointers, advance the one with smaller end.

        theory: `
### 1 · Intuition
When an array contains numbers in the range [1, n] (or [0, n-1]), each number x belongs at index x-1 (or x). Cyclic sort iterates through the array: if the current number isn't at its correct position, **swap it there**. After one pass, every number is at its "home" index, and any mismatches reveal missing or duplicate values.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
  i = 0
  while i < n:
    correct = arr[i] - 1          // where arr[i] should be

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Find missing number, find all duplicates, find the duplicate, first missing positive, set mismatch.
**Complexity** — O(n) time (each element swapped at most once), O(1) space.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**After sorting**, scan for mismatches: if arr[i] != i+1, then i+1 is missing and arr[i] is duplicate/misplaced.
**First Missing Positive**: ignore numbers ≤ 0 or > n during the cyclic-sort phase.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Find Missing Number (1 to n)**: after cyclic sort, the index where arr[i] != i+1 is the answer.
• **Find All Duplicates**: after sort, positions where arr[i] != i+1 hold duplicates.
• **First Missing Positive**: filter to [1,n] range, cyclic sort, scan for first mismatch.

### 1 · Intuition
Every integer is a sequence of bits. Bitwise operations process all bits in parallel in O(1). Key identity: **a XOR a = 0** and **a XOR 0 = a**. This means XOR-ing all elements cancels out pairs, revealing the single unique element.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
**Single Number**: XOR all elements → pairs cancel, single remains.
  result = 0
  for num in arr:
    result ^= num

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Single number (XOR), power of 2 checks (n & (n-1) == 0), counting set bits (Brian Kernighan's), bit masking for subsets/states, toggling/setting/clearing individual bits.
**Key operations**: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), right shift (>>).

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Common identities**: n & (n-1) clears lowest set bit. n & (-n) isolates lowest set bit. XOR is associative & commutative.
**Counting bits**: Brian Kernighan — while n: n &= (n-1), count++ → O(set bits).

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Single Number**: XOR all → O(n) time O(1) space.
• **Single Number II (every element appears 3 times except one)**: count bits modulo 3.
• **Two singles**: XOR all gives a^b. Use any set bit to partition into two groups, XOR each group.
• **Power of 2**: n > 0 && (n & (n-1)) == 0.
• **Subsets via bitmask**: for mask in 0 to 2^n-1, bit i set means include element i.

### 1 · Intuition
A **Trie** stores strings character by character along tree edges. All strings sharing a common prefix share the same path from the root. This makes prefix operations — autocomplete, spell check, word search — blazing fast: O(L) per operation where L is the word length, regardless of how many words are stored.

Some problems need you to track the **median** of a growing stream, or divide elements into two balanced groups. A single heap can't do this — but TWO heaps can. Keep a **max-heap** for the smaller half and a **min-heap** for the larger half. The median is always at one (or both) heap tops.

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Sliding window median** — Need lazy deletion: mark removed elements, only actually pop when they appear at heap top.
**IPO problem** — Max-heap for profits, min-heap for capitals. Greedily pick highest profit among affordable projects.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Find Median from Data Stream**: classic two-heap setup. Handle odd/even counts via size comparison.
• **Sliding Window Median**: two heaps + lazy deletion hash map for O(n log n) total.

### 1 · Intuition
BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs. For **weighted** graphs (non-negative weights), **Dijkstra's algorithm** generalizes BFS by using a **min-heap** instead of a queue. Always process the node with the smallest known distance first — this greedy choice guarantees optimality.

### 2 · Step-by-Step Build-up
  dist = [∞] * n
  dist[source] = 0
  minHeap = [(0, source)]     // (distance, node)

  while minHeap:
    (d, u) = minHeap.pop()
    if d > dist[u]: continue   // stale entry
    for (v, weight) in adj(u):
      if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
        dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
        minHeap.push((dist[v], v))

### 3 · Formal Pattern Template
**When to use** — Shortest path in weighted graph (non-negative weights), network routing, cheapest flights, path with minimum effort.
**Fails when** — Negative edge weights (use Bellman-Ford instead).
**Complexity** — O((V + E) log V) with binary heap. O(V² + E) with array-based (dense graphs).

### 4 · Deep Dive
**Negative weights** — Dijkstra fails; use Bellman-Ford O(VE) or SPFA.
**All pairs** — Run Dijkstra from each node: O(V(V+E) log V). Or use Floyd-Warshall O(V³).
**0-1 BFS** — Special case with edge weights 0 or 1 → deque-based BFS suffices.

### 5 · Hidden Tricks & Pro Tips
• **Cheapest Flights with K Stops**: modified Dijkstra with state (node, stops_remaining). Or BFS/DP.
• **Network Delay Time**: Dijkstra from source; answer = max(dist[]) if all reachable.
• **Path with Minimum Effort**: Dijkstra where "distance" = max edge weight along the path (modified relaxation).
• **Swim in Rising Water**: Dijkstra on grid; weight = max(elevation_along_path).
• **Stale entries**: when popping from heap, skip if d > dist[u] — faster than decrease-key.
• **Multi-source Dijkstra**: push all sources with dist=0. Same pattern as multi-source BFS.
